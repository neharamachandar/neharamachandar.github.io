### Projects:

Analyzing the Impact of Google BARD on Search Engine Dynamics

Abstract: 
This report examines the impact of Google's introduction of Bard, a text generation model powered by LaMDA large language model, on the company's revenue generation. With Google's traditional revenue source being advertising, Bard was perceived as a revolutionary technology that could potentially disrupt the search industry and shift the balance of power away from Google search. However, Bard's focus on generating creative and expressive content rather than surfacing links to answers could indicate that it might not directly compete with Google's search business. Instead, it may find applications in fields such as literature, advertising, and education. The report investigates whether Bard is an innovative addition to Google's suite of AI-powered products or whether it will have a negative impact on Google's search business revenue.


Objectives:
- Analyzing the Usage Patterns of Google's Search Engine
- Analyzing the Revenue Generated by Google's Search Engine
- Factors Affecting the Revenue Generated by Google Bard
- Market Risk for the Release of Google Bard Chabot
- Comparison between Google Search and Google Bard.

  Achievements:

- Conducted an exhaustive analysis of Google's traditional search engine usage/revenue against a generative AI-based large language model, BARD.
- Examined user patterns, assessed potential future revenue streams, identified market risks associated with Bard's release using Mixpanel, SEMrush and SWOT 
  analysis yielding High-end estimate 15-25% shift within specific user segments.
- Explored how Bardâ€™s direct answer capabilities could disrupt Google's ad-driven business model by implementing content-based filtering, NLP algorithms and K- 
  means clustering (CRM) rendered results suggest direct answers of bard can reduce click-through rates (CTRs) by up to 50%.
- Report includes optimized mitigation techniques for Bard's Limitations and Google's Adaptability potentially enhancing the user experience and mitigating revenue 
  losses focusing CTRs.
