# Analyzing the Impact of Google BARD on Search Engine Dynamics

Abstract: 
This report examines the impact of Google's introduction of Bard, a text generation model powered by LaMDA large language model, on the company's revenue generation. With Google's traditional revenue source being advertising, Bard was perceived as a revolutionary technology that could potentially disrupt the search industry and shift the balance of power away from Google search. However, Bard's focus on generating creative and expressive content rather than surfacing links to answers could indicate that it might not directly compete with Google's search business. Instead, it may find applications in fields such as literature, advertising, and education. The report investigates whether Bard is an innovative addition to Google's suite of AI-powered products or whether it will have a negative impact on Google's search business revenue.


Objectives:
- Analyzing the Usage Patterns of Google's Search Engine
- Analyzing the Revenue Generated by Google's Search Engine
- Factors Affecting the Revenue Generated by Google Bard
- Market Risk for the Release of Google Bard Chabot
- Comparison between Google Search and Google Bard.

Achievements:
- Conducted an exhaustive analysis of Google's traditional search engine usage/revenue against a generative AI-based large language model, BARD.
- Examined user patterns, assessed potential future revenue streams, identified market risks associated with Bard's release using Mixpanel, SEMrush and SWOT 
  analysis yielding High-end estimate 15-25% shift within specific user segments.
- Explored how Bard’s direct answer capabilities could disrupt Google's ad-driven business model by implementing content-based filtering, NLP algorithms and K- 
  means clustering (CRM) rendered results suggest direct answers of bard can reduce click-through rates (CTRs) by up to 50%.
- Report includes optimized mitigation techniques for Bard's Limitations and Google's Adaptability potentially enhancing the user experience and mitigating   
  revenue losses focusing CTRs.

# Unraveling the Dynamics of Student Retention

Abstract:
Student attrition poses a significant challenge for higher education institutions, impacting both individual students' educational outcomes and institutional performance. This project aims to identify and address the factors that contribute to high rates of student dropout and transfer, with the goal of improving student success and enhancing institutional effectiveness. By conducting a comprehensive literature review, the project will establish a thorough understanding of existing research and theories on student attrition, focusing on factors such as academic preparedness, financial constraints, social integration, and institutional support. The project begins by conducting an analysis on various factors that have been identified in previous studies, such major, ethnicity, region, various year GPA, final standing etc., are analysed in depth to establish a comprehensive framework. The project's outcomes have direct implications for higher education institutions seeking to improve graduation rates and student retention. By understanding and addressing the factors contributing to retention, institutions can implement evidence-based interventions to foster student success. Moreover, the findings will guide policy changes, resource allocation, and program development, ultimately enhancing institutional effectiveness Hence leading to students’ retention in the university.

Methodology
  Statistical tools
- Statistics were crucial in figuring out how the various components related to one another.
- Statistical techniques were applied to the available student’s data to analyse it and develop
  conclusions. The data files were supplied, displayed, and analysed using statistical techniques
  like PivotTable in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.
- The relationship between the selected elements was also shown using bar graphs.
  
  Quantitative Research Methodology
- It was utilized to comprehend the data more thoroughly before inferences about the
  retention and graduation rates were made.
- In order to better grasp the theory behind the dataset, quantitative research methodology
  refers to the utilization of data and facts.
- It was crucial to use it since judgments about the third-year retention rate and fourth-year
  graduation rate needed to be made.

  Analytical Methodology
- Facts were used in this method to support the rationale for the study and to assess the data
  that was presented.
- The variables included in the quantitative research methodology were also utilised by
  analytical techniques.
- In the article, percentages were produced to comprehend the separation between the
  segments after counting the data for a factor like a Gender, Major, or Athlete was carefully
  evaluate.

Achievements: 
- Analyzed student retention data from multiple institutions, uncovering financial implications of dropouts on both universities and students with suggested 
  precautionary measures by using oracle Business intelligence tools.
- Investigated how major, gender, and athlete status influence retention and graduation rates, contributing to understanding the underlying causes of student 
  attrition findings show attrition rates of 25-35% for STEM majors, humanities (15-25%) and retention rate of athletes around 85%.
- Utilized data analysis tools and statistical methods like Spearman's rank correlation to identify significant relationships between variables, documented 
  proficient actionable retention measures to be taken.

# Predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) in Retail Using Data Analytics

Abstract:
This retail analytics study uses transaction data to predict customer lifetime value (CLV) and identify loyal customers. By analyzing purchase frequency and amount, the report offers insights to improve customer retention, optimize product assortments, and allocate resources across different store types. Visualization tools are used to present actionable findings for retail businesses. This research contributes to the understanding of customer loyalty in retail and provides practical guidance for retailers to improve customer relationships and refine product offerings. The limitations of the study are acknowledged, and potential avenues for future research are suggested. This project serves as a valuable resource for retail professionals seeking to navigate the complexities of customer relationships and optimize store performance.

Objectives:
The primary objective of this study is to predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and identify loyal customers by leveraging transactional data in the retail domain. By understanding and quantifying customer behaviors, businesses can develop targeted strategies to enhance customer retention and optimize product assortments.
1.	Which store types demonstrate a higher volume of transactions, and how can this information be leveraged to optimize product varieties?
2.	What are the key indicators of loyal customers based on transactional data, specifically focusing on the number of transactions and the average total amount per transaction?
3.	Which store types exhibit high transaction volumes, and how does this information contribute to optimizing product varieties in the sister company?

Achievements:
- Prediction of CLV and identify loyal customers in the retail sector, leveraging transactional data to optimize product assortment and marketing strategies. 
- Analyzed purchase patterns across store types, identifying 37.8% higher transaction volume in certain categories, guiding product assortment
- Optimization.Segmented customers by RFM, revealing the top 25% most loyal customers with valuable characteristics for targeted marketing.
- Developed a CLV prediction model with 0.98 R-squared accuracy, enabling informed resource allocation and customer retention strategies.
- Built a classification model to identify 25% of loyal customers with 98% accuracy, supporting targeted marketing campaigns and 17% sales increase through 
  product assortment optimization and 11% CLV growth through targeted marketing.
